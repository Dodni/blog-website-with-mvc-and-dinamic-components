# blog-website-with-mvc-and-dinamic-components
I made a blog website with MVC pattern and with dinamic components. The navbar datas load from DB and so on
# It was a sprint project. I had to make it in 4 days for an job applyment.
So my code is sometimes doesn't perfect, but I prefer clean and readable codes.
